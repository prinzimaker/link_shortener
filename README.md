## &#11088; **Quick and dirty link shortener** - **v1.4.1**
### _March 2025 release_

This is a good and functional release, and security seems good too.\
You can use this app out of the box, simply copying it on a minimal LAMP server (see the DOC folder).

At this release you need to create and manage users using direct access to database.
I'm looking for someone gives me a hand writing the complete users handling (and some other user checks/limits too).
Write to aldo@milleisole.com if interested, thank you.

### NOTE
This project was developed with the malicious hacking perspective in mind. Consequently, it was built in a somewhat non-standard way and uses techniques that make hacking and spam more difficult. Of course, more can be done, but it was my precise intention to write this software by adopting creative, out-of-the-box methods so that “standard” hacking tools would not easily apply to the project. 

Feel free, of course, to modify anything you want in your fork, or actively participate in this project—always keeping hacking and spam fight in mind. 

Thank you :) \
