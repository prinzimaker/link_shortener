# Prinzimaker's Link Shortener

## **Quick and dirty link shortener** - **v1.4.0**
### Mar 2025 release

This is a good and functional release, and security seems good too.\
You can use this app out of the box, simply copying it on a minimal LAMP server (see the DOC folder).

At this release you need to create and manage users using direct access to database.
I'm looking for someone gives me a hand writing the complete users handling (and some other user checks/limits too).
Write to aldo@milleisole.com if interested, thank you.
